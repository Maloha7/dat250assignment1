# Expass 5

## Technical problems that I encountered during the completion of the tutorial

When following the tutorials I decided to create different packages for each of the experiments instead of initializing new projects with the spring boot initializer each time. 
Because of this I had some issues when trying to add new dependencies to the initial project. I solved this problem by looking at gradle build file in the spring-guides repository and copying the corret artifacts.
